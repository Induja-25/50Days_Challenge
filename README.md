# Excel Basics – Cell Formatting, Sorting & Filtering

This folder contains my Day 1 practice as part of my Data Analyst learning journey.  
The goal of this module is to build a strong foundation in Excel — one of the most essential tools for any Data Analyst.

## 📘 1. Cell Formatting

In the `Cell_Formats` sheet, I practiced different types of formatting, including:

- **Number Formatting** (1,500)
- **Currency Formatting** (₹1,500.00)
- **Date Formatting** (05-Jan-2024)
- **Percentage Formatting** (25%)
- **Text Formatting**

These formatting techniques help present data clearly and make reports easier to read.

## 📊 2. Sorting

In the `Sorting` sheet, I worked with a small employee dataset and applied:

- **A → Z sorting** (Department)
- **Largest → Smallest sorting** (Salary)

Sorting helps organize data to find patterns such as highest values, lowest values, or alphabetical ordering.

## 🔍 3. Filtering

In the `Filtering` sheet, I used filters to:

- Show only specific departments (e.g., Sales)
- Display salaries above a certain value (e.g., > 28000)

Filtering makes it easier to analyze specific segments of data without changing the original dataset.

## 🎯 Why This Practice Is Important

These are foundational Excel skills required for roles such as:

- Data Analyst  
- Junior Data Analyst  
- Reporting Analyst  
- MIS Executive  

Understanding formatting, sorting, and filtering is essential before moving into PivotTables, dashboards, SQL, or Power BI.

## 🚀 Next Steps

I will continue adding new practice files and projects for:
- Excel (advanced analysis)
- SQL
- Power BI
- Python (pandas)
- Full Data Analytics projects

Stay tuned as I grow this repository during my Data Analyst learning journey!
