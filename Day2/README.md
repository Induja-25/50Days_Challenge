# Excel Day 2 – Text Functions

This folder contains my Day 2 practice for the Data Analyst 50‑Day Challenge.  
The focus of this practice is on **text functions**, which are important for cleaning messy datasets.

## ✔ Functions Practiced:
- `LEFT()` – Extract characters from the left  
- `RIGHT()` – Extract characters from the right  
- `MID()` – Extract characters from the middle  
- `LEN()` – Count characters  
- `TRIM()` – Remove extra spaces  
- `CONCAT()` – Combine text

These functions are commonly used when cleaning data such as product codes, names, emails, and IDs.
